## Hand in 1

In this assignment we are given a scenario where Alice and Bob are trying to communicate through the network. Alice wants to send Bob 2000 kr to Bob, but since the network is so insecure, they decide to use asymmetric cryptohraphy.

Before starting, there are useful information that we can list:

* The generator g has value 666
* The shared prime number p has value 6661
* Bob's public key is 2227

Now the first step is to send Bob 2000 kr through an encrypted message. The process to encrypt this message is to include Bob's public key, which in this case is 2227.


1. Alice will pick a random number generated by our r = random.randInt(0, 1000) method and compute g^r (666^r), which she will call for c1. 

Next, she uses Bob's public key, the random number, the message (2000) she wants to send and computes (2000 * 2227^r), which she calls c2. She then sends the ciphertext c as a pair (c1, c2) to Bob.

2. However, in the middle of the network, Eve is catching the message and trying to decrypt Alice's message. Eve knows the generator g, the prime p, and Bob's public key so she only needs Bob's secret key. She decides to bruteforce by looping through the equation (666^x % 6661 = 2227) swapping out x with it index. After some time she finds out that x = 66 gives Bob's public key, thus 66 is his private key. 

She now decrypts the message like the following:
    
c2 / c1 (g^r^66 % p) = 2000

The reason we can extract the message from this equation is because:

c2 = m * (g^r^sk)
c1 = g ^ r

When we divide c2 with c1^sk (g^r^sk) we end up with the message since they cross eachother out.

3. Mallory wants to change the value of the message to be 6000 instead of 2000 without knowing Bob's private key. She simply catches the message over the network and multiplies c2 with 3 since the value of c2 is initially 2000. The reason why we don't touch c1 is because it doesn't contain the message.
